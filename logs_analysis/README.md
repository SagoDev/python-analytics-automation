# Log Analysis Automation

Automated analysis of system and application logs to detect anomalous patterns, measure log volume behavior, and extract operational insights.

This project processes raw log files, applies structured parsing and cleaning logic, computes key log-related metrics, identifies anomalies, generates visualizations, and exports consolidated reports to support monitoring, troubleshooting, and operational decision-making.
